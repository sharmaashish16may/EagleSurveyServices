	<p><b>This privacy policy explains how SurveyMonkey handles your personal information and data. We value your trust, so we've strived to present this policy in clear, plain language instead of legalese. 
	The policy is structured so you can quickly find answers to the questions which interest you the most.</b></p>

<p>This privacy policy applies to all the products, services and websites offered by SurveyMonkey.com, LLC, SurveyMonkey Europe Sarl, and their affiliates, except where otherwise noted. We refer to those products, services and websites collectively as the "services"" in this policy. 
Some services have supplementary privacy statements that explain in more detail our specific privacy practices in relation to them. Unless otherwise noted, our services are provided by SurveyMonkey.com, LLC inside of the United States and by SurveyMonkey Europe Sarl outside of the United States.</p>
	
	<p><b>TRUSTe.</b> SurveyMonkey.com, LLC has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and our privacy practices have been reviewed TRUSTe, an independent third party, for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements, which include transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.</p>

	<h3>Key Privacy Points: The Stuff You Really Care About</h3>
	<h5>IF YOU CREATE SURVEYS:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Your survey data is owned by you. Not only that, but SurveyMonkey treats your surveys as if they were private. We don't sell them to anyone and we don't use the survey responses you collect for our own purposes, except in a limited set of circumstances (e.g. if we are compelled by a subpoena, or if you've made your survey responses public).</li>
		<li>We safeguard respondents' email addresses. To make it easier for you to invite people to take your surveys via email, you may upload lists of email addresses, in which case SurveyMonkey acts as a mere custodian of that data. We don't sell these email addresses and we use them only as directed by you and in accordance with this policy. The same goes for any email addresses collected by your surveys.</li>
		<li>We keep your data securely. Read our Security Statement for more information.</li>
		<li>Survey data is stored on servers located in the United States. More information about this is available if you are located in Canada or Europe. SurveyMonkey will process your survey data on your behalf and under your instructions (including the ones agreed to in this privacy policy).</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>IF YOU ANSWER SURVEYS:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Surveys are administered by survey creators. Survey creators conduct thousands of surveys each day using our services. We host the surveys on our websites and collect the responses that you submit to the survey creator. If you have any questions about a survey you are taking, please contact the survey creator directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that survey or your responses to it. The survey creator is usually the same person that invited you to take the survey and sometimes they have their own privacy policy.</li>
		<li>Are your responses anonymous? This depends on how the survey creator has configured the survey. Contact them to find out, or click here to read more about respondent anonymity.</li>
		<li>We don't sell your responses to third parties. SurveyMonkey doesn't sell or share your survey responses with third party advertisers or marketers (although the survey creator might, so check with them). SurveyMonkey merely acts as a custodian on behalf of the survey creator who controls your data.</li>
		<li>If you think a survey violates our Terms of Use or may be engaging in illegal activity, click here to report it.</li>
